	<div id="about_me"
	<p>I’d like to think that I have a pretty chill personality. Or at least that's the one word I would use to describe it. As of morals and beliefs, I was raised a Muslim and taught to be very peaceful. Although as a child, I was a bit too crazy. I do believe in mostly peace now but I do have some personal beliefs as everyone should be able to defend themselves. As I said earlier, I think I have a pretty laid back chill mood most of the time. But I can get pretty energetic when I am with my friends or when I am doing something sports related. I also am very nice to most people and try best to not be offensive, but with some of my closest friends I can be playing around and say some mean things. I also am very shy when meeting new people and I’m bad at breaking the ice. But once I do really get to know a person, I really can get close to a person if I talk to them for a while. As for interests, I am interested in many things. Some might be sports, where I am very interested in basketball and what goes on in the NBA. I also love the sport of wrestling, partly because of my great middle school coaches.</p>

	<p>I am also interested in many other things like technology. I am interested in technology in whole, like the business and what new technology is made. But I’m very interested in many software programs. I would love to fully learn to program, as I have only done a few classes many years ago. I also would learn how to make animations as that seems like a very fun way to showcase my creativity. One thing I am interested in and would love to learn in the future is how to produce beats or mix music. I do have many preferences and dislikes. Like I hate some repetitive music but love music that has grand production. This could be why I like Kanye West over Justin Bieber or somebody like that. This kinda spills in with the people that I like. I like people that know how to move and have great confidence in themselves. I don't like having a person that hates themselves or is not confident in their ideas. This is because many times I have met a person who has something amazing to say or do and was too shy to do or didn't believe in themselves enough. I am an individual and I can have many similarities with many people, but it’s the arrangements of personal selections that make me unique. I wonder how this will change in the future.</p>
